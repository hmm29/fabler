# Fabler

Fabler is a native mobile application for collaborative, turn-based story writing. 

It is the premier platform for on-the-go, collaborative novel building. 
â€¨Fabler stands out due to its turn-based nature, a characteristic of most group activities / games. At the core of the Fabler experience is the process of accretion, which enables players to build there stories in an easy, sentence-by-sentence fashion. Each turn requires little effort and involves adding one sentence or less.

Fabler is on a mission to empower individuals with a story-writing network that allows them to achieve authorship.
